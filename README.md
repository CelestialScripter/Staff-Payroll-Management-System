# Payroll-Management System
Full Stack Payroll Management System for admins using mysql and php.

# Overview:
The procedure through which a business pays its employees for work completed during a given time period is known as payroll. A payroll system enables organizations to adhere to a predetermined set of procedures in order to make accurate payments on time and in accordance with legal requirements. Calculating employee pay and documenting payroll transactions are normally part of the payroll procedure. A University must have a timekeeping system in place that accurately records the hours worked by employees, the number of days worked, and the regular salary payments for exempt staff. The objective of this project is to create this system in a secure manner, in accordance with industry-based security standards for doing so.
